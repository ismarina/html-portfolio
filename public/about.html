<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have a unique blend of experiences that can contribute value to your work. My very first encounter
  with art was starting at 8 years old when everything in sight I had to draw. I took that to the next
  level when it came to high school and had a few exhibitions of my graphite work. I also worked for the Sun-Sentinel
  as an illustrator. From there in college I picked up many skills like Graphic Design when I worked in the 
  sports department of University of Florida and created their pamphlets and brochures. I also learned printmaking, painting,
  sculpting. My work in college was helped me dive into many new artistic skills for future work.

<p>But it was in college when I started to take a turn to the more technical side of the arts. Entering the 
  Electronic Intermedia field, I was able to explore the raw performance side of the arts and mix that
  in with video art. My work in video took a greater passion and turned into a career in video editing.
  For many years I was a video editor, creating indie movies and documentaries for directors, internal highlight reels for companies,
  video art for professional artists, social media films and so forth. Creating videos were a passion of mine, 
  and still is, but my interests sometimes veered to making websites, some for the companies I worked for and some
  for friends of mine. I enjoyed the different creative liberties I could take and felt a new kind of passion arising from this.

<p>Finally, I decided to change my career around and go for the adventure of designing websites, but also not only 
  to create something visually. I wanted to challenge my mind with the world of coding. I am currently in 
  that process of learning all types of computer languages. For it is computer I return to full circle, since I have always
  used it as a tool to create my work. I am excited to learn the world of coding, and where it could take me, desing or developer I am 
  open to both. I enjoy the world in which I can control and make things work as well as seeing aesthetically pleasing work. I hope
  to take that journey further with people who have a great passion for this and will continue striving to learn more, as there will always
  be more information, such as AI. To be continued!...
